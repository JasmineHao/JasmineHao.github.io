## Working Papers

### **Building up Trust in a Dynamic Game: A study on Collusive Price-fixing in the Chilean Pharmaceutical Retail Industry**[Job Market Paper]

This paper discusses firms' coordination issues when initiating collusion. 
By understanding the economics behind the initiation of collusion, the government can tailor policies to prevent collusion from emerging. The paper is the first to model the firms' initiation problem. 
The work contributes to understanding the firms' learning-to-coordination process. From empirical researches, we observe that firms exhibit post-cartel tacit collusion. The observations indicate that once firms build up trust, the market is vulnerable to collusion. 
Literature in collusion focuses on the *implementation* but overlooks the *initiation* of collusion. This paper provides a tractable model that considers firms' *incentive problems* and *coordination problems* separately. 
We relaxes the rational expectations by estimating firm-specific "belief parameter" that disentangle firms' information acquisition processes from firms' strategic interactions. 
Identifying the belief parameters relies on two exclusion restrictions: 
(1) one firm's lagged pricing decision affects his payoff through adjustment costs while other firms' lagged pricing decisions do not. 
(2) The profits on a given market are not affected by the market outcomes in other markets. The framework with nonequilibrium belief represents the data observed better than the rational expectation model.

### **Using Euler equation to estimate non-finite-dependent dynamic discrete choice model with unobserved heterogeneity**(joint work with *Hiro Kasahara*)

In the dynamic discrete choice analysis, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity is an important issue, and finite mixture models provide flexible ways to account for it. The previous discussion of incorporating finite mixture model in the dynamic discrete choice model focuses on a class of models where the difference in future value terms depends on a few conditional choice probabilities(finite dependence property). In models that do not exhibit finite dependence property, it is computationally costly to estimate finite mixture models with the expectation-maximization(EM) algorithm. Following the previous discussion of the finite mixture in dynamic discrete choice with finite dependence property, this paper adopts the EM algorithm to incorporate unobserved heterogeneity for a broader range of dynamic discrete choice model that does not require the finite dependence property. Following the Euler Equation(EE) representation of dynamic discrete decision problems, we provide an alternative conditional choice probability (CCP) value function representation that relies only on the CCP of one action. Contrasting to the Hotz-Miller CCP representation that relies on all the conditional choice probabilities, this characterization avoids the matrix inversion in each EM iteration. The matrix inversion can be computed outside the EM iterations and therefore is computationally attractive. The characterization provides unbiased estimator for models with and without finite dependence property. We illustrate the computational gains with Monte Carlo simulations.

### **Testing the number of components in finite mixture model with normal panel regression**(joint work with *Hiro Kasahara*)

This paper develops the likelihood-ratio based test of the null hypothesis of a $m_0$-component model against an alternative of $(m_0+1)$-component model in the normal mixture panel regression. I show that the normal mixture panel regression does not suffer from the Fisher Information matrix degeneracy under the reparameterization proposed in Kasahara and Shimotsu(2012). As a result, the likelihood ratio test statistic can be approximated by a local quadratic expansion of squares and products of the reparameterized parameters. Moreover, I obtain the data-driven penalty function via computational experiments to attend to unbounded likelihood ratio. In addition, I apply the test to random coefficient Cobb-Douglas production function estimation following the framework of Gandhi et al.(2013) and Kasahara and Shimotsu(2015). The empirical findings suggest evidence of heterogeneous production technology beyond Hicks-neutral technology factor.
