    <p><strong>Building up Trust in a Dynamic Game: A study on Collusive Price-fixing in the Chilean Pharmaceutical Retail Industry</strong>[Job Market Paper]
  <!-- 
  <span style="text-decoration: underline">**Abstract**</span> We propose a dynamic pricing game of incomplete information where firms' beliefs about competitors' prices can be biased, what creates a coordination problem to achieve a collusive outcome.
  We apply the model to study the initiation stage of a price-fixing cartel in Chilean pharmaceutical retailing industry.
  In this case, firms initially collude to raise prices on a small set of markets and later expand this collusion to a larger set of markets.  
  We show that the coordination problems explain the slow transition of firms' pricing from a non-collusive equilibrium to a collusive equilibrium: without accounting for the coordination problem, the firms raise prices on all markets instantly. 
  We evaluate the effect of a counterfactual "divestiture" policy on the initiation stage, where a "divestiture" requires firms to sell part of their assets to a non-cartel member.  We show the importance of accounting for the coordination problems problem in policy evaluation.

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In the dynamic discrete choice analysis, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity is an important issue, and finite mixture models provide flexible ways to account for it. The previous discussion of incorporating finite mixture model in the dynamic discrete choice model focuses on a class of models where the difference in future value terms depends on a few conditional choice probabilities(finite dependence property). In models that do not exhibit finite dependence property, it is computationally costly to estimate finite mixture models with the expectation-maximization(EM) algorithm. Following the previous discussion of the finite mixture in dynamic discrete choice with finite dependence property, this paper adopts the EM algorithm to incorporate unobserved heterogeneity for a broader range of dynamic discrete choice model that does not require the finite dependence property. Following the Euler Equation(EE) representation of dynamic discrete decision problems, we provide an alternative conditional choice probability (CCP) value function representation that relies only on the CCP of one action. Contrasting to the Hotz-Miller CCP representation that relies on all the conditional choice probabilities, this characterization avoids the matrix inversion in each EM iteration. The matrix inversion can be computed outside the EM iterations and therefore is computationally attractive. The characterization provides unbiased estimator for models with and without finite dependence property. We illustrate the computational gains with Monte Carlo simulations.

<p>In dynamic decision problems, agents can make both discrete and continuous choices at the same time. 
The existence of both types of choices is natural under some circumstances. For example, empirical industrial organization literature examines firmsâ€™ entry and investment decisions. 
The decision of entry is discrete, and the decision of investment is continuous.  \citet{Blevins2010} provides identification results of the class of dynamic discrete-and-continuous-choice models. We show the discrete-and-continuous model is equivalent to the agentsâ€™ making decisions that map every possible state to an outcome simultaneously.  With the property, the agentâ€™s future value can be represented as the discounted payoff from repeatedly taking an arbitrary action.  The estimation technique is the first to account for the Dynamic decision models with discrete-continuous-mix choices.</p>

<p>This project uses administrative vehicle registration data from one of Chinaâ€™s major cities to identify consumersâ€™ preference over household vehiclesâ€™ gas-efficient attributes over time. 
We propose to evaluate the long-run effect of electric vehicles(EV) adoption policy on the consumerâ€™s preference using administrative data from one major city in China. The data contains registration, transfer and disposal record from January 2010 to the present. The administrative data include the Vehicle Identification Number(VIN) of the registered vehicle, the household district information, the gender, and the consumerâ€™s date of birth.
The identification relies on the relative preference of high displacement vehicles and low displacement vehicles. 
The Chinese tax structure creates a discontinuity in demand for the displacement attribute. The Chinese government imposes a 7.5 % consumption tax for a vehicle with engine displacement below 1.6 litres and a 10 % tax for those above 1.6 litres.
The level of the difference between vehicle above 1.6-litre displacement compared to those below 1.6 litres conditional on rebate program for electric cars over time can explain whether the consumersâ€™ preference for environmentally friendly cars has changed.</p>
