<p>In dynamic decision problems, agents can make both discrete and continuous choices at the same time. 
The existence of both types of choices is natural under some circumstances. For example, empirical industrial organization literature examines firmsâ€™ entry and investment decisions. 
The decision of entry is discrete, and the decision of investment is continuous.  \citet{Blevins2010} provides identification results of the class of dynamic discrete-and-continuous-choice models. We show the discrete-and-continuous model is equivalent to the agentsâ€™ making decisions that map every possible state to an outcome simultaneously.  With the property, the agentâ€™s future value can be represented as the discounted payoff from repeatedly taking an arbitrary action.  The estimation technique is the first to account for the Dynamic decision models with discrete-continuous-mix choices.</p>

<p>This project uses administrative vehicle registration data from one of Chinaâ€™s major cities to identify consumersâ€™ preference over household vehiclesâ€™ gas-efficient attributes over time. 
We propose to evaluate the long-run effect of electric vehicles(EV) adoption policy on the consumerâ€™s preference using administrative data from one major city in China. The data contains registration, transfer and disposal record from January 2010 to the present. The administrative data include the Vehicle Identification Number(VIN) of the registered vehicle, the household district information, the gender, and the consumerâ€™s date of birth.
The identification relies on the relative preference of high displacement vehicles and low displacement vehicles. 
The Chinese tax structure creates a discontinuity in demand for the displacement attribute. The Chinese government imposes a 7.5 % consumption tax for a vehicle with engine displacement below 1.6 litres and a 10 % tax for those above 1.6 litres.
The level of the difference between vehicle above 1.6-litre displacement compared to those below 1.6 litres conditional on rebate program for electric cars over time can explain whether the consumersâ€™ preference for environmentally friendly cars has changed.</p>
