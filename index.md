I am currently an Assistant Professor at the HKU Business School. Prior to joining HKU, I completed my Ph.D. at the Vancouver School of Economics, part of the University of British Columbia.
I earned my BBA in Accounting from Xiamen University and my BA in Mathematical Economics from the University of Waterloo.
My primary research interests lie in the fields of Industrial Organization and Econometrics.
<!-- My job market paper examines the coordination issue when building up a cartel based on a price-fixing case in the Chile pharmaceutical retailing industry in the year of 2008. 
I find that firms need time to adapt to the change of strategies before they eventually commit to a collusive equilibrium. 
The findings are useful for competition policy intervention targeting firms' coordination issues.
