I am an assistant professor at the HKU Business School. Before joining HKU, I did my Ph.D. at the Vancouver School of Economics, the University of British Columbia. 
My research interests are in Industrial Organization and Econometrics. 
<!-- My job market paper examines the coordination issue when building up a cartel based on a price-fixing case in the Chile pharmaceutical retailing industry in the year of 2008. 
I find that firms need time to adapt to the change of strategies before they eventually commit to a collusive equilibrium. 
The findings are useful for competition policy intervention targeting firms' coordination issues.
