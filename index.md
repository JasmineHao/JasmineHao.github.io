I am a job market candidate at the Vancouver School of Economics,
the University of British Columbia. 
My research interests are in Industrial Organization and Econometrics. 
My job market paper examines the coordination issue when building up a cartel based on a price-fixing case in the Chile pharmaceutical retailing industry in the year of 2008. 
I find that firms need time to adapt to the change of strategies before they eventually commit to a collusive equilibrium. 
The findings are useful for competition policy intervention targeting firms' coordination issues. 

I will be available for interviews at the 2020 CEEE meeting, the 2020 EEA meeting, the 2020 CICE meeting and the 2021 ASSA/AEA meeting. I expect to graduate in 2021.
